-How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Understanding what users need usually begins with looking at the system. This can involve getting feedback from the team and asking past users about any mistakes or improvements they want to see in the code. It's also important to figure out the inputs and outputs.
User stories are useful for collecting information since they allow users to share their needs and desires. By reviewing these stories, we can gain insight into the perspective of the end users.

-How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
There are a few different ways to develop programs. One method is the Waterfall Method, which is useful for outlining the requirements of a particular strategy.
Another approach is Agile. Agile appears to provide a more adaptable strategy and offers a distinct way to handle testing, planning, and working with clients.

-What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
In my opinion, being a good team player means knowing your role in the project and staying on track so you don’t hold others back. I also believe it’s important to listen to your teammates and offer help to anyone who needs it.
